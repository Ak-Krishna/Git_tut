$git log --oneline --graph                      --> Used to provide a graph of commits 
$git branch -d branchname                       --> use to delete specific branch w.r.t branchname


// Normal merge
- from where the branch is created that commit(master) called as base commit
- in normal merge we have to do a merge commit when we merge two branches
- in normal merge we have to execute only one command to merge branch i.e $git merge branchname
- in normal merge we can directly push brach to remote repository
- in normal merge conflits between files will be encountered

// Rebase 
- when we do rebase the commits of feature branch are attached to master branch main commit 
- always switch to that brach which brach you are rebasing to master branch
- use command $git rebase master
- after rebase the head is point to new commit of rebased branch
- the commit id will change after rebase 
- after rebase you have to switch to master branch for merging the two branch
- use command $git merge feature 
- rebase is used to overcome conflicts

// Cloning remote repositoty
- use command $git clone url
