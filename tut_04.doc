- git branching is used for parallel developement.
- if we create a new branch it will inheritate all files and commits of main branch
- before switch to another branch, you should commit all changes in current branch,
  if you did not then all changes will impacted to another branch too
  
$git branch                  --> use to see all branch
$git branch "branchname"     --> use to create branch 
$git checkout "branchname"   --> use to switch between two branches
$git checkout -b "bn"        --> use to create and switch to particular branch
$echo a.txt b.txt            --> use to create files

//Merging
a) fast-forward merge:
   - we will not touch master branch once we create a another brach 
   - we only do changes in feature branch and then merge it to master branch, it's called as FF merge
   - we will not face to any conflicts
   - $git merge feature                 --> used to merge to branches

b) Three-way merge:
   - we chan touch master branch once we create a another brach 
   - we  do changes in feature and master branch and then merge it to master branch.
   - we will face lots of  conflicts

- always at the time of merging you should switch to master branch
