- git branching is used for parallel developement.
- if we create a new branch it will inheritate all files and commits of main branch
- before switch to another branch, you should commit all changes in current branch,
  if you did not then all changes will impacted to another branch too
  
$git branch                  --> use to see all branch
$git branch "branchname"     --> use to create branch 
$git checkout "branchname"   --> use to switch between two branches
$git checkout -b "bn"        --> used to create and switch to particular branch
